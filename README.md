#The Catz Paw

A very simple application that calls two different API's
- https://catfact.ninja/
- https://cataas.com/#/

The random image and random cat fact are then rendered to the application through local component state.
This simple application was created to help me shake off the rust after spending a lot of time with Python and Kotlin over the last few months on another project.
